# Brave Origin Windows Unlocker

A TypeScript utility for unlocking Brave Origin features on Windows by modifying the local application state.

## Features

- ✅ Unlocks Brave Origin features
- ✅ Modifies purchase validation state
- ✅ Updates SKU credentials
- ✅ Windows-compatible local data path handling

## Requirements

- **Deno** - Modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- **Windows OS** - Designed for Windows file paths
- **Brave Origin** - The browser being modified
- **File Write Permissions** - Access to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` directory

## Installation

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.land/) if you haven't already
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash

## Why Run the Windows Unlocker Instead of WSL? 🤔

Running the Windows unlocker natively is typically a better choice than running a browser inside WSL. Here's why:

1. **Performance**: The native Windows experience generally offers better performance than emulated environments like WSL. ⚡
2. **Simplicity**: You avoid complex setups and configurations, making it more straightforward for users of all levels. 🛠️
3. **Compatibility**: Some features and functionalities might only work seamlessly in a Windows environment, ensuring you get the most out of your tools. 🔗  
4. **User Experience**: Enjoy a more intuitive interface and fewer problems managing dependencies. 😊
